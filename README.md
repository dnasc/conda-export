# conda-export
Exports all available conda environments as .yaml files. For instance, if you have two conda environments 
named `conda1` and `conda2`, the command `python conda-export.py` will create two files `conda1.yaml` and `conda2.yaml`
containing each environment package configuration, respectively.
